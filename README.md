# Apollo Server 2.0 Boilerplate

A simple example on how you can set up Apollo Server 2.0 in standalone mode. I try to follow best practices regarding folder structure and configuration.

I am happy about any suggestions and clarifications!

Have fun with Apollo ✌️

## Getting started

```sh
# To start the server, run
> npm start

# In order to run the server in watch (development) mode
> npm run watch
```
